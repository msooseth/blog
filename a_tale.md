# A Tale of Shift Right, Frontrunning, and MEV

NIST [Cybersecurity Framework's five Functions](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions) are: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Within this framework "shift left" means that we shift our focus towards Identify and Protect, i.e. towards fixing issues before it the system is deployed into production. Say, if you have a bug in your Apple Store/Google Play app, you prefer fixing it before you deploy it to the internet, or, similarily you prefer fixing the bug in your cryptocurrency contract before you deploy it in the wild. While "shift left" makes lots of sense (let's prevent the issue in the first place!), in some sense, it's also impossible. When writing code, practicioners, i.e. developers, are, what safety literature would call, at the "sharp edge". They are like airplane pilots, directly at the control of the craft. While it's easy to imagine that pilots are in "full control", in reality, airplane pilots depend on many things to do their job: accurate weather reports, proper training, certifications for the airplane, proper maintenance, production pressure from corporate, etc. These are what safety literature calls the "blunt end" -- things that contribute to both success and failure, but are not directly visible/obvious. What this boils down to in terms of "shift left" is that while developers are at the controls on paper, in reality, there is a large "blunt end" that they have little to no control over, and which may set up conditions that lead to failure, even if the developers did all precautions. Easy examples of this are previously unknown vulnerability classes

In the past decade or so, there's been a "shift right"
